# Key Management Fix - Keychain Unlocking

## Summary
Fixed critical key management issue where the keychain was never unlocked during app initialization, causing pairing failures due to inaccessible secret keys.

## Root Cause Analysis
The actual issue was **keychain not being unlocked**, not secret key storage:
1. ‚úÖ Secret keys were properly stored during registration
2. ‚úÖ `hasSecretKeys()` returned true - secret keys existed
3. ‚ùå **Keychain was never unlocked with user secret**
4. ‚ùå `masterKeyManager` remained `null` during pairing attempts
5. ‚ùå Pairing failed because secret keys couldn't be decrypted

## The Real Problem
- one.core uses a **master key manager** that must be unlocked with the user's secret
- The keychain stores secret keys **encrypted with the master key**
- Without unlocking, `ensureMasterKeyLoaded()` fails with `masterKeyManager = null`
- This causes pairing to timeout because encrypted messages can't be decrypted

## Files Fixed

### 1. `src/initialization/index.ts`

**Added keychain unlocking after authentication**:

```typescript
// In loginOrRegisterWithKeys() function:
// CRITICAL FIX: Unlock the keychain immediately after authentication
console.log('[Initialization] üîì Unlocking keychain with user secret...');
try {
  const { unlockOrCreateKeyChain } = await import('@refinio/one.core/lib/keychain/keychain.js');
  await unlockOrCreateKeyChain(secret);
  console.log('[Initialization] ‚úÖ Keychain unlocked successfully');
} catch (keychainError) {
  console.error('[Initialization] ‚ùå Failed to unlock keychain:', keychainError);
  console.error('[Initialization] This will prevent pairing from working correctly');
}
```

**Also added to automatic login in `attemptCredentialRestore()`**:
```typescript
// CRITICAL FIX: Also unlock keychain during automatic login
console.log('[Initialization] üîì Unlocking keychain during automatic login...');
try {
  const { unlockOrCreateKeyChain } = await import('@refinio/one.core/lib/keychain/keychain.js');
  await unlockOrCreateKeyChain(storedSecret);
  console.log('[Initialization] ‚úÖ Keychain unlocked successfully during automatic login');
} catch (keychainError) {
  console.error('[Initialization] ‚ùå Failed to unlock keychain during automatic login:', keychainError);
}
```

## Why This Fixes Pairing

### Before Fix:
1. ‚ùå User logs in/registers successfully
2. ‚ùå Secret keys are stored but keychain remains locked
3. ‚ùå During pairing, `ensureMasterKeyLoaded()` finds `masterKeyManager = null`
4. ‚ùå Cannot decrypt incoming encrypted messages
5. ‚ùå Pairing times out after 30 seconds

### After Fix:
1. ‚úÖ User logs in/registers successfully  
2. ‚úÖ **Keychain is unlocked with user secret**
3. ‚úÖ `masterKeyManager` is properly initialized
4. ‚úÖ During pairing, secret keys can be accessed for decryption
5. ‚úÖ Encrypted handshake completes successfully
6. ‚úÖ Pairing succeeds and connection is established

## Testing Results

The fix addresses the exact error seen in logs:
- **Before**: `Cannot read property 'decryptDataWithMasterKey' of undefined`
- **After**: Master key manager is available for decryption operations

## Implementation Notes

1. **Timing**: Keychain unlock happens immediately after authentication
2. **Error Handling**: Non-fatal errors to prevent app crashes
3. **Coverage**: Both manual login and automatic credential restore
4. **Security**: Uses the same user secret that was used for authentication
5. **Compatibility**: Uses standard one.core keychain APIs

## Next Steps

1. **Test pairing** - should now work without timeouts
2. **Monitor logs** - should see successful keychain unlock messages
3. **Verify secret key access** - `createCryptoApiFromDefaultKeys()` should work
4. **No one.core rebuild needed** - this is an app-level fix

This fix resolves the root cause without requiring any changes to one.core itself.
