Observer Pattern Implementation
==========================

Overview
--------
This implementation provides a lightweight, type-safe observer pattern that can be easily migrated to one.models in the future. It follows the reactive programming paradigm while maintaining compatibility with the existing OEvent system.

Key Features
-----------
1. Type Safety: Full TypeScript generic support for type-safe observations
2. Value Management: Maintains and provides access to current value state
3. Immediate Emission: New subscribers immediately receive current value
4. Automatic Cleanup: Returns unsubscribe functions for proper cleanup
5. System Compatibility: Converts to OEvent for legacy system support

Usage Examples
-------------
Basic Usage:
```typescript
const nameObservable = createObservable<string>("John");

// Subscribe to changes
const unsubscribe = nameObservable.subscribe(name => {
    console.log(`Name changed to: ${name}`);
});

// Update value
nameObservable.next("Jane");

// Clean up when done
unsubscribe();
```

Legacy System Integration:
```typescript
const observable = createObservable<number>(0);
const oEvent = observable.toOEvent();
// Use with existing OEvent-based code
```

Design Decisions
---------------
1. Separation of Concerns:
   - Clear distinction between observer and observable roles
   - Simple, focused API for value updates and subscriptions

2. Value Management:
   - Optional initial values
   - Immediate value emission to new subscribers
   - Current value access through getValue()

3. Type System:
   - Generic type parameter for type-safe observations
   - Consistent typing across all methods

4. Memory Management:
   - Automatic cleanup through unsubscribe functions
   - No circular references that could cause memory leaks

Migration Path
-------------
The implementation is designed to be easily migrated to one.models:
1. Simple data flow model matches reactive patterns
2. Clear separation of concerns
3. Type-safe implementation
4. Minimal dependencies

Future Considerations
-------------------
1. Error handling mechanisms could be added
2. Operator functions (map, filter, etc.) could be implemented
3. Async observation patterns could be supported
4. Additional utility methods could be added as needed
