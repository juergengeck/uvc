# Task ID: 119
# Title: Implement Phase 2: CommServer Registration Protocol
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Send registration message with listening: true, handle authentication challenge from CommServer, complete challenge-response authentication, and receive registration confirmation.
# Details:


# Test Strategy:


# Subtasks:
## 1. Define Registration Message Structure [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the structure and format for the registration message that includes a 'listening: true' flag.
### Details:
Design the JSON or protocol buffer schema to include necessary fields such as client ID, listening status, and any other metadata required by CommServer. Ensure compatibility with existing communication protocols.

## 2. Implement Message Sending Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 119.1
### Description: Develop the logic to send the registration message to CommServer.
### Details:
Use appropriate network libraries or frameworks to establish a connection with CommServer and transmit the defined registration message. Handle potential network errors gracefully.

## 3. Handle Authentication Challenge [pending]
### Dependencies: 119.2
### Description: Implement logic to receive and process authentication challenges from CommServer.
### Details:
Listen for incoming messages from CommServer. Identify and parse authentication challenge messages, extracting necessary information such as nonce or challenge parameters.

## 4. Complete Challenge-Response Authentication [pending]
### Dependencies: 119.3
### Description: Implement the logic for responding to CommServer's authentication challenge.
### Details:
Generate appropriate responses based on the received challenge, using cryptographic methods if necessary. Send the response back to CommServer and handle any errors or retries as needed.

## 5. Receive Registration Confirmation [pending]
### Dependencies: 119.4
### Description: Implement logic to receive and verify registration confirmation from CommServer.
### Details:
Listen for a confirmation message from CommServer. Validate the contents of this message to ensure successful registration, including checking any status codes or messages indicating success.
