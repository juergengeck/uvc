# Subtasks:
## 1. Receive Connection Handover from CommServer [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement the logic to receive and process connection handover requests from the CommServer.
### Details:
Develop a listener or handler that waits for incoming connection handover messages. Parse these messages to extract necessary information such as session identifiers, peer details, and any initial state data required for establishing the P2P connection.

## 2. Initialize PairingConnection State [pending]
### Dependencies: 121.1
### Description: Set up the initial state for a PairingConnection upon receiving a connection handover.
### Details:
Create or update data structures to represent the state of the P2P connection. This includes initializing variables and objects that will manage the connection's lifecycle, such as session identifiers, peer information, and status flags.

## 3. Set Up Challenge-Response Handling [pending]
### Dependencies: 121.2
### Description: Implement the challenge-response mechanism to authenticate the P2P connection.
### Details:
Develop a protocol for sending and receiving challenges. This involves generating cryptographic challenges, sending them to the peer, and verifying responses. Ensure that both sides can generate and validate these challenges to confirm authenticity before proceeding with key exchange.

## 4. Prepare for Key Exchange Protocol [pending]
### Dependencies: 121.3
### Description: Establish the groundwork necessary for a secure key exchange between peers.
### Details:
Implement the initial steps required for a cryptographic key exchange protocol, such as Diffie-Hellman. This includes generating public/private key pairs and preparing any shared secrets or parameters needed for the exchange process.
