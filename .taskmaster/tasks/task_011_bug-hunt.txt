# Task ID: 11
# Title: Reimplement CHUM Protocol Entry
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 10
# Priority: high
# Description: Initiate the CHUM protocol upon new connection establishment.
# Details:
Create a new, Expo-compatible entry point for the `chum-sync` protocol. Ensure it does not rely on unsupported features like dynamic `eval` or `new Function()`.

# Test Strategy:
Unit and integration tests to verify that the CHUM protocol initiates correctly without using disallowed JavaScript features.
