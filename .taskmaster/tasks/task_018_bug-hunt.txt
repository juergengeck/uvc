# Title: Fix SharedArrayBuffer polyfill to work with one.models/one.core in React Native
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 4, 17
# Priority: high
# Description: Ensure the SharedArrayBuffer polyfill works correctly within the one.models/one.core context in React Native.
# Details:
1. Analyze the current implementation of the SharedArrayBuffer polyfill in index.js.
2. Identify why the polyfill fails to reach the one.core NetworkPlugin context during runtime.
3. Modify the polyfill to ensure it is properly applied across all execution contexts, including those within node_modules dependencies.
4. Test the polyfill's behavior in various scenarios to confirm its reliability and compatibility with React Native environments.

INVESTIGATION FINDINGS - SharedArrayBuffer Polyfill Scope Issue:

Root Cause Analysis:
1. No Direct References: SharedArrayBuffer is not directly referenced in one.core source code.
2. Runtime Error: The error occurs at runtime in NetworkPlugin.onMsgHandler.
3. Polyfill Scope: Current polyfill in index.js only affects the main thread global scope.
4. Module Context: one.core modules may execute in different contexts where polyfill isn't applied.

Potential Causes:
- Feature Detection: Some dependency checking for SharedArrayBuffer availability.
- Dynamic Code: Runtime code generation that references SharedArrayBuffer.
- Worker Context: Code executing in worker threads without polyfill.
- Hermes Engine: React Native's Hermes engine specific behavior.

Solution Strategy:
1. Move polyfill application earlier in startup sequence to ensure it is available across all contexts.
2. Create a patch for one.core to include the polyfill internally, ensuring consistent availability within its modules.
3. Test the polyfill in different execution contexts, including main thread and worker threads, to confirm comprehensive coverage.
4. Verify NetworkPlugin functionality after applying the fix to ensure no runtime errors persist.

# Test Strategy:
1. Write unit tests for the SharedArrayBuffer polyfill to verify that it correctly initializes in different execution contexts.
2. Integrate the modified polyfill into a test environment mimicking one.models/one.core usage.
3. Perform end-to-end testing by simulating network connections and data exchanges to ensure no 'ReferenceError: SharedArrayBuffer is not defined' occurs.
