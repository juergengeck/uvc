# Task ID: 19
# Title: Fix critical SharedArrayBuffer error in message handling pipeline
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 18, 17
# Priority: high
# Description: Resolve the issue where the SharedArrayBuffer polyfill fails during onMsgHandler callback context, causing connection closure with pending requests.
# Details:
1. Review the current implementation of the SharedArrayBuffer polyfill and its usage within the onMsgHandler function.
2. Identify any potential issues related to context or environment differences between message processing and onMsgHandler execution.
3. Modify the polyfill to ensure compatibility across all relevant contexts, including those in node_modules dependencies.
4. Test the modified polyfill in various scenarios to confirm its reliability and compatibility with React Native environments.

# Test Strategy:
1. Write unit tests for the SharedArrayBuffer polyfill to verify correct initialization and behavior in different execution contexts.
2. Integrate the modified polyfill into a test environment mimicking one.models/one.core usage.
3. Perform end-to-end testing by simulating network connections and data handling to ensure no connection closures occur with pending requests.
