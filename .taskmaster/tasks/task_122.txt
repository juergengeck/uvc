# Task ID: 122
# Title: Implement Phase 5: Encryption Setup
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Handle key exchange messages, create temporary keypair, derive shared key for EncryptionPlugin, set up EncryptionPlugin on connection, and validate encryption.
# Details:


# Test Strategy:


# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Key Exchange Message Handling [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop the functionality to handle incoming and outgoing key exchange messages.
### Details:
Create methods for parsing, validating, and responding to key exchange messages. Ensure that these methods can be integrated with existing communication protocols.

## 2. Generate Temporary Keypair [pending]
### Dependencies: 122.1
### Description: Create a temporary keypair for secure key exchanges.
### Details:
Implement functionality to generate a new public/private key pair using a suitable cryptographic library. Ensure that the keys are securely generated and stored temporarily during the session.

## 3. Derive Shared Key for EncryptionPlugin [pending]
### Dependencies: 122.2
### Description: Use the temporary keypair to derive a shared encryption key.
### Details:
Implement Diffie-Hellman or another suitable algorithm to compute a shared secret using the temporary keypair and the peer's public key. Use this shared secret as the basis for deriving the encryption key.

## 4. Set Up EncryptionPlugin on Connection [pending]
### Dependencies: 122.3
### Description: Integrate the EncryptionPlugin into the connection setup process.
### Details:
Modify the connection initialization code to include the setup of the EncryptionPlugin using the derived shared key. Ensure that all data transmitted over the connection is encrypted and decrypted appropriately.

## 5. Validate Encryption Setup [pending]
### Dependencies: 122.4
### Description: Ensure the encryption setup works as expected under various conditions.
### Details:
Perform end-to-end testing to validate that the entire encryption process, from key exchange to data transmission, functions correctly. Test for edge cases and potential security vulnerabilities.
