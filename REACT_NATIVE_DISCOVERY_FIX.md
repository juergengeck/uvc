# React Native Discovery Protocol Fix

## Issues Fixed

### 1. DeviceId Serialization Bug
**Problem**: The app was sending `deviceId: "[object Object]"` in discovery packets instead of a proper string ID.

**Root Cause**: When `DeviceDiscoveryModel` was initialized, `_appOwnDeviceId` might not be properly set as a string, causing object serialization issues.

**Fix**: Added validation and fallback in `DeviceDiscoveryModel.ts`:
```typescript
// Ensure deviceId is a string - use temporary ID if not yet set
const deviceIdForDiscovery = this._appOwnDeviceId && typeof this._appOwnDeviceId === 'string' && this._appOwnDeviceId.length > 0
  ? this._appOwnDeviceId
  : `temp-${Math.random().toString(36).substring(2, 12)}`;
```

Also updated the `setOwnIdentity` method to properly update the DiscoveryProtocol's config when the real deviceId is set.

### 2. Discovery Continues After Device Pairing
**Problem**: The app continued sending discovery broadcasts even after successfully pairing with an ESP32 device.

**Root Cause**: No logic existed to stop discovery when a device ownership was established.

**Fix**: Implemented two mechanisms:
1. **Check before starting**: Added logic to check for owned devices before starting discovery
2. **Stop on authentication**: When an ESP32 device is authenticated and we're the owner, automatically stop discovery

```typescript
// In onDeviceAuthenticated listener
if (device.ownerPersonId === this._personId) {
  console.log(`[DeviceDiscoveryModel] We own device ${device.id} - stopping discovery broadcasts`);
  await this.stopDiscovery();
}
```

## Result
- The app now sends proper deviceId strings in discovery packets
- Discovery automatically stops when a device is paired
- ESP32 devices only broadcast when they have no owner
- Reduced network traffic after pairing

## Future Improvements
1. Persist paired device information across app restarts
2. Add UI indication when discovery is stopped due to existing pairing
3. Add manual discovery restart option for users who want to pair multiple devices
