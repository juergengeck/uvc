Here's how a TLS 1.3 handshake could work using verifiable credentials instead of DNS certificates:

### Modified TLS 1.3 Handshake with Verifiable Credentials

1. **ClientHello**
   - Client sends supported cryptographic parameters
   - Includes indication of supported verifiable credential formats/schemes
   - Optionally includes client's own verifiable credentials

2. **ServerHello + EncryptedExtensions**
   - Server selects cryptographic parameters
   - Generates ephemeral key share
   - Immediately establishes encryption for remainder of handshake

3. **Server Credential Presentation** (replacing Certificate message)
   - Server sends its verifiable credentials
   - Includes proof of possession for credential subject
   - Contains credential metadata (issuer, schema, expiration)
   - May include selective disclosure proofs if privacy is required

4. **Credential Verification Data** (replacing CertificateVerify)
   - Server signs handshake context with private key associated with the verifiable credential
   - Proves control of the credential without exposing private key

5. **Client Verification**
   - Client validates the credential's cryptographic integrity
   - Verifies the credential against trusted issuers (replacing Certificate Authorities)
   - Checks credential hasn't been revoked using status protocol
   - Confirms server has proven possession of credential

6. **Finished Messages**
   - Both parties exchange Finished messages containing HMAC of the handshake

### Key Differences from Traditional TLS

- Trust is anchored in credential issuers rather than Certificate Authorities
- Identity is based on verifiable claims rather than domain names
- Supports selective disclosure of attributes (can prove properties without revealing everything)
- Can include zero-knowledge proofs for enhanced privacy
- Revocation could use decentralized methods like status registries or blockchains

The system would require standardizing:
- Verifiable credential formats accepted in TLS
- How credentials are mapped to identities
- Which signature schemes are supported
- How revocation status is checked
