# Llama.rn Fix Cleanup

This document records the cleanup performed to remove residue from previous complex fixing approaches for the llama.rn double header import issue.

## Files Removed

The following deprecated files were removed:

- `patches/fix-llama-headers.js` - Old approach using complex header modifications
- `patches/llama-xcframework-fix.patch` - Deprecated patch that modified XCFramework directly

## Simplified Approach

Our current approach uses three components designed to be compatible with Expo prebuild:

1. `ios-custom-modules/fix-llama-headers.sh` - Robust bash script that fixes the XCFramework issues
2. `ios-custom-modules/Podfile.hooks.rb` - Ruby hooks that are automatically included during prebuild
3. `llama-module-plugin.js` - Expo config plugin that ensures the fixes are applied

## Prebuild Compatibility

We've specifically designed our solution to work with Expo's prebuild workflow:

1. Rather than modifying files in `ios/` (which get overwritten during prebuild), we place all our fixes in `ios-custom-modules/`
2. The `Podfile.hooks.rb` file is automatically included by Expo during the prebuild process
3. Our fix script runs during CocoaPods installation, after the prebuild process has completed

This ensures that our fixes are applied regardless of whether the iOS folder is regenerated.

## Documentation

Additional documentation has been added:

1. Added llama.rn integration section to README.md
2. Created `llama-rn-fix.md` with detailed explanation of the issue and solution
3. Updated to include specific instructions for prebuild workflow

## Benefits

This cleanup:

1. Reduces codebase complexity
2. Focuses on fixing the root cause of the double header issue
3. Makes the solution easier to understand and maintain
4. Eliminates complex workarounds that were hard to debug
5. Provides clear documentation for future reference
6. Ensures compatibility with Expo prebuild workflow
