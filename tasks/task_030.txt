# Task ID: 30
# Title: Fix CommServer Protocol Phase Implementation
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Fix the CommServer protocol phase implementation to properly handle authentication, encryption, and pairing protocol exchange.
# Details:
**ACTUAL ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED**: The issue was not route lifecycle management but incomplete CommServer protocol implementation.

**PROTOCOL PHASES IMPLEMENTED**:
âœ… **Registration Phase**: Working correctly - sends register command with public key
âœ… **Authentication Phase**: Working correctly - handles challenge/response with proper key matching
ðŸ”§ **Encryption Phase**: Fixed Buffer compatibility issue for React Native
ðŸ”„ **Pairing Phase**: In progress - implementing person/instance exchange protocol

**KEY FIXES COMPLETED**:
1. **Authentication Context Storage**: Fixed AuthenticationPhase to store symmetric key in context
2. **Encryption Setup**: Fixed EncryptionPhase to read authentication context and enable encryption
3. **Buffer Compatibility**: Replaced Buffer.from() with React Native compatible hex conversion
4. **Key Mismatch Resolution**: Fixed Instance vs Person key usage in authentication

**CURRENT STATUS**:
- Authentication succeeds and generates symmetric key
- Encryption context is properly passed between phases  
- NetworkPlugin encryption support implemented
- Next: Complete person/instance exchange protocol after encryption

**PROTOCOL SEQUENCE**:
1. Registration â†’ Authentication â†’ Encryption â†’ Pairing
2. Pairing includes: person_id_object â†” keys_object â†” instance_id_object exchange
3. After pairing: Normal encrypted message exchange

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify all protocol phases complete successfully
2. Test encryption/decryption of messages after authentication
3. Confirm person/instance exchange works with edda.one
4. Test bidirectional pairing and message exchange

# Subtasks:
## 1. Complete Encryption Phase Implementation [in-progress]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Ensure encryption is properly enabled after authentication and can decrypt peer messages
### Details:
Fixed Buffer compatibility issue. Need to verify encryption/decryption works with incoming binary messages from peer.

## 2. Implement Person/Instance Exchange Protocol [pending]
### Dependencies: Encryption Phase
### Description: Complete the one.models person/instance exchange protocol after encryption setup
### Details:
Implement simultaneous bidirectional exchange:
- Send person_id_object, wait for peer's person_id_object
- Send keys_object, wait for peer's keys_object  
- Perform key challenge/response (binary messages)
- Send instance_id_object, wait for peer's instance_id_object

## 3. Test End-to-End Protocol with edda.one [pending] 
### Dependencies: Person/Instance Exchange
### Description: Validate complete protocol works with live one.leute instance
### Details:
Test invitation acceptance from edda.one, verify all protocol phases complete, confirm bidirectional messaging works.
