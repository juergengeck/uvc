# Task ID: 21
# Title: Create ModelService registry for clean dependency injection
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement a centralized service that manages model instances and their dependencies, replacing the scattered model creation and access patterns throughout the codebase. This service should handle model lifecycle, provide type-safe model access, and support proper dependency injection patterns.
# Details:
To achieve this task, we need to design and implement a ModelService registry that will manage the lifecycle of model instances and their dependencies. The registry should provide a centralized location for creating, accessing, and managing models, while also ensuring proper dependency injection patterns. We will need to identify the key requirements and constraints of the registry, such as model registration, instance creation, and dependency resolution. Additionally, we will need to consider the technical approach, including data structures, algorithms, and potential pitfalls. The goal is to create a robust and maintainable ModelService registry that improves testability and maintainability of the codebase.

# Test Strategy:
The test strategy for this task involves verifying the correctness of the ModelService registry by creating model instances, testing dependency injection patterns, and ensuring proper model lifecycle management. We will also need to perform unit tests and integration tests to validate the registry's functionality and identify potential issues.
