# Task ID: 1
# Title: Verify WebSocket Implementation Consistency
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Ensure both lama and edda use the same WebSocket implementation with proper ping/pong handling
# Details:
The core issue was that pairing used generic WebSocket instead of Expo-specific WebSocket with ping/pong handling. Fixed in EncryptedConnectionHandshake.ts by changing import from '@refinio/one.core/lib/system/websocket.js' to '@refinio/one.core/lib/system/expo/websocket.js'

# Test Strategy:
Verify that lamaâ†’edda pairing no longer fails with 'ping is not valid JSON' errors. Test bidirectional pairing multiple times.
