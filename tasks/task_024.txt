# Task ID: 24
# Title: Fix missing CommServer connection event handlers for invite acceptance
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Add onUnknownConnection and onKnownConnection event listeners in AppModel to properly route incoming pairing connections from commserver to PairingManager, enabling self-created invitations to work like edda.one invitations
# Details:
To fix the missing CommServer connection event handlers, we have added the necessary event listeners to the AppModel. This includes handling both unknown and known connections, ensuring that incoming pairing connections are properly routed to the PairingManager. Self-created invitations now function identically to those from edda.one.

# Test Strategy:
Verify that self-created invitations work as expected by sending them via CommServer and checking their proper handling in AppModel and PairingManager.
