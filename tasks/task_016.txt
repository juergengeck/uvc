# Task ID: 16
# Title: Fix database integrity violation in contact creation: "Cannot read property getObject of undefined"
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Fix the critical error identified from console logs that prevents contact creation, ensuring proper relationships and avoiding orphaned identities.
# Details:
1. Remove incorrect this.leuteModel.instance.getObject() calls (instance is a singleton in one.core)
2. Fix SomeoneModel.constructWithNewSomeone() to use correct parameters: (personId, profileIdHash) not LeuteModel instance
3. Add proper Profile creation step before Someone creation following ONE object relationship pattern
4. Implement correct sequence: Person -> Profile -> Someone -> Add to contacts
Expected result: Contact creation should work properly, showing green connection status and enabling topic creation for messaging.

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify console logs no longer display errors after implementing changes.
2. Test contact creation functionality with sample data, ensuring proper relationships and identities are established.
