# Task ID: 11
# Title: Implement ESP32 Device Discovery Integration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop ESP32 device discovery capabilities as the next phase of the networking architecture, enabling IoT device participation in the federated network.
# Details:
Building on the UDP â†’ QuicVC foundation, implement device discovery specifically for ESP32 embedded devices. This represents the third phase of the networking architecture roadmap and will enable mesh networking with IoT devices as first-class network participants. Integration with ESP-IDF development environment.

# Test Strategy:
Deploy test ESP32 devices, verify discovery protocol, test communication between mobile app and embedded devices, ensure proper network topology formation.
