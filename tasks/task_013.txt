# Title: Consolidate and clean up scattered documentation files
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Consolidate and clean up scattered documentation files throughout the project to improve organization and findability.
# Details:
This task involves reviewing current relevance of existing .md files, consolidating them into appropriate locations (docs/ folder, task descriptions, or code comments), removing outdated/redundant files, and preserving important information in structured task documentation. The goal is to create a more organized and maintainable documentation system that aligns with the project's architecture and technical requirements.

# Test Strategy:
1. Review current relevance of existing .md files using a standardized checklist. 2. Consolidate relevant files into designated locations (docs/ folder, task descriptions, or code comments). 3. Remove outdated/redundant files and ensure all remaining files are properly formatted and consistent with project standards. 4. Verify that important information is preserved in structured task documentation. 5. Test the new documentation system by creating a sample document and verifying its accuracy, completeness, and consistency with existing documentation.
