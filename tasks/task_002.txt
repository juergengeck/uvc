# Task ID: 2
# Title: Validate CommServer Listener Setup
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Ensure CommServer listeners are properly configured after TrustModel initialization
# Details:
Fixed timing issue where listenForIncomingConnections() was called before TrustModel initialization. Moved the call to _initializeModels() after TrustModel.init() completes successfully.

# Test Strategy:
Verify no 'TrustModel not initialized' errors in logs. Check that CommServer listeners are established after login.
