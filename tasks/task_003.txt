# Task ID: 3
# Title: Optimize Crypto API Usage
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement crypto API caching to reduce frequent secret key retrievals
# Details:
Added crypto API caching in TrustModel to prevent constant secret key retrieval spam. TrustModel now provides getCryptoApi() method that caches crypto APIs per person ID.

# Test Strategy:
Monitor logs for reduced frequency of '[SecretKeyStorage] Retrieving secret keys' messages. Should see significant reduction in crypto API creation calls.
