# ESP32 Watchdog Reset - Complete Solution

## Final Root Cause Analysis

The ESP32 was experiencing watchdog resets due to **multiple issues**:

1. **IDLE Task Starvation**: High-priority tasks (4-5) were preventing the IDLE task (priority 0) from running
2. **GPIO Pin Conflict**: The display module was trying to use GPIO 6 for I2C, which conflicts with internal flash on standard ESP32

## The Complete Fix

### 1. Lowered Task Priorities
Changed all task priorities from 4-5 to 1:
```c
xTaskCreate(unified_service_task, "unified_service", 4096, NULL, 1, NULL);
xTaskCreate(led_task, "led_task", 2048, NULL, 1, NULL);
xTaskCreate(display_task, "display_task", 4096, NULL, 1, NULL);
```

### 2. Added Explicit Yields
Added `taskYIELD()` calls in tight loops to ensure IDLE task runs:
```c
// In fast LED mode
vTaskDelay(100 / portTICK_PERIOD_MS);
taskYIELD();  // Critical for IDLE task
```

### 3. Disabled Display Task
The display module was configured for ESP32-C3 pins (GPIO 5/6) which conflict with ESP32 flash:
```c
// DISABLED: GPIO 6 conflicts with flash on standard ESP32
ESP_LOGW(TAG, "Display task disabled - GPIO pins 5/6 conflict with ESP32 flash");
```

## Why Initial Solutions Failed

1. **Wrong Approach**: Adding watchdog feeds (`esp_task_wdt_add/reset`) was treating the symptom, not the cause
2. **Missing Context**: The watchdog monitors IDLE tasks, not user tasks
3. **Hardware Conflict**: Display initialization was crashing due to GPIO conflict

## Key Lessons

1. **Always check sdkconfig** to understand watchdog configuration
2. **Task priorities matter** - don't starve system tasks
3. **Hardware pin conflicts** can cause immediate crashes
4. **Proper analysis beats quick fixes** - understanding the system is crucial

## Testing the Fix

```bash
# Build
. $HOME/esp/esp-idf/export.sh
idf.py build

# Flash
idf.py -p /dev/cu.usbserial-110 flash

# Monitor
idf.py -p /dev/cu.usbserial-110 monitor
```

## Current Status

With the complete fix:
- No more watchdog resets
- Tasks run with proper priorities
- IDLE task gets CPU time
- Display functionality disabled to avoid GPIO conflicts
- System runs stably

## Future Improvements

1. **Configure display pins** properly for standard ESP32 (e.g., GPIO 21/22)
2. **Add runtime configuration** to enable/disable display
3. **Implement proper hardware detection** with timeouts
4. **Add stack usage monitoring** to prevent overflows
