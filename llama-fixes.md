# Llama.rn Integration Fixes

## Overview of Changes

We've fixed the integration of the llama.rn module to work properly in the simulator environment by removing fallbacks and extraneous checks that were causing problems. The key issues were:

1. **Module Import Structure**: The code was incorrectly importing functions directly from llama.rn instead of accessing them through the module's default export
   
2. **TurboModule Resolution**: The code wasn't properly handling TurboModule resolution, which needs to be done through the TurboModuleRegistry

3. **Redundant Checks and Fallbacks**: There were excessive checks and fallbacks that were actually causing problems rather than solving them

## Files Changed

1. `src/utils/llama.js`:
   - Simplified to directly expose native module functions
   - Removed redundant checks and fallbacks
   - Uses direct TurboModuleRegistry.getEnforcing without try/catch

2. `src/models/ai/LlamaModel.ts`:
   - Removed redundant module availability checking
   - Simplified initialization process
   - Removed extra error handling that was causing issues

3. `src/models/ai/LLMManager.ts`:
   - Improved context cleanup process
   - Simplified model loading implementation
   - Removed redundant method checks

## Key Implementation Details

### Module Resolution

The proper way to resolve TurboModules in React Native is:

```javascript
import { TurboModuleRegistry } from 'react-native';
const RNLlama = TurboModuleRegistry.getEnforcing('RNLlama');
```

### Native Module Spec

The RNLlama module is properly defined in XCode as we can see in the generated spec file:

```objectivec
@protocol NativeRNLlamaSpec <RCTBridgeModule, RCTTurboModule>
- (void)toggleNativeLog:(BOOL)enabled
                resolve:(RCTPromiseResolveBlock)resolve
                 reject:(RCTPromiseRejectBlock)reject;
- (void)setContextLimit:(double)limit
                resolve:(RCTPromiseResolveBlock)resolve
                 reject:(RCTPromiseRejectBlock)reject;
- (void)modelInfo:(NSString *)path
             skip:(NSArray *)skip
          resolve:(RCTPromiseResolveBlock)resolve
           reject:(RCTPromiseRejectBlock)reject;
- (void)initContext:(double)contextId
            // etc.
```

### Simplified Error Handling

We've simplified error handling throughout the codebase:

1. Let errors propagate naturally instead of trying to catch and re-throw them
2. Use meaningful error messages that describe what went wrong
3. Remove redundant checks that were masking the real issues

### Simulator Detection

We kept the improved simulator detection in LlamaModel.ts to apply more conservative settings:

```javascript
const isSimulator = this.modelPath.includes('CoreSimulator') || 
                    this.modelPath.includes('Simulator') ||
                    this.modelPath.includes('/Developer/') ||
                    this.modelPath.includes('Devices/') && this.modelPath.includes('Application/');
```

### Conservative Resource Allocation

When running in the simulator, we still use more conservative settings:

- Smaller context sizes (down to 256 tokens)
- Single-threaded execution
- Smaller batch sizes (32 instead of 512)
- No GPU acceleration

## Next Steps

These changes should allow models to properly load in the simulator environment. If issues persist:

1. Add a native module mock that provides simulated responses for testing
2. Isolate the specific native method causing issues by adding more detailed logging
3. Verify that the native module implementation in `ios/Pods/Target Support Files/llama-rn` is built correctly
