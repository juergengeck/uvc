# Before Making Changes

Before making any changes to the codebase:
1. Understand what is going on in the current implementation
2. Analyze the problem thoroughly
3. Identify existing patterns and conventions
4. Verify your understanding by examining related code
5. Only then implement changes with confidence

This prevents introducing bugs, breaking existing functionality, or creating redundant code.
