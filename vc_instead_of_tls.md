# Verifiable Credentials Instead of TLS

## Overview

Traditional web security relies on TLS certificates issued by Certificate Authorities (CAs) to establish trust and secure communications. In a federated, peer-to-peer environment where every mobile device acts as a "server," we can replace this centralized trust model with Verifiable Credentials (VCs) for more flexible, decentralized authentication and authorization.

## Why VCs Instead of TLS?

### Problems with TLS in Federated Environments

**Certificate Authority Dependency**
- Requires centralized CA infrastructure
- CA compromise affects entire system
- Certificate revocation complexity
- Cost and administrative overhead

**Identity Limitations** 
- TLS certificates primarily identify domains/servers
- Poor support for user/device identity
- No fine-grained permissions or attributes
- Static trust relationships

**Mobile/P2P Challenges**
- Dynamic IP addresses break certificate validation
- NAT/firewall traversal issues
- No built-in support for temporary connections
- Difficult certificate management on mobile devices

### Advantages of Verifiable Credentials

**Decentralized Trust**
- No single point of failure
- Self-sovereign identity principles
- Cryptographic proof without centralized validation
- Flexible trust networks

**Rich Identity Model**
- Can encode complex attributes and permissions
- Support for multiple identity types (users, devices, organizations)
- Time-bound and conditional access
- Revocation without centralized infrastructure

**Mobile-Native**
- Works with dynamic connectivity
- Offline verification capabilities
- Easy key rotation and management
- Natural fit for app-based distribution

```

## VC-Based Authentication Flow

### 1. Initial Connection
```javascript
// CommServer connection (unauthenticated transport)
{
  self: "mobile-app-alice",
  other: "mobile-app-bob"
}
```

### 2. VC Presentation Exchange
```javascript
// Alice presents her credential
const presentation = {
  "@context": ["https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1"],
  "type": ["VerifiablePresentation"],
  "verifiableCredential": [{
    "@context": ["https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1"],
    "type": ["VerifiableCredential", "FederatedNodeCredential"],
    "issuer": "did:key:alice-issuer",
    "credentialSubject": {
      "id": "did:key:alice-node",
      "nodeType": "mobile-federated-server",
      "permissions": ["read", "write", "relay"],
      "validUntil": "2025-12-31T23:59:59Z"
    },
    "proof": {
      "type": "Ed25519Signature2020",
      "created": "2025-07-22T10:00:00Z",
      "verificationMethod": "did:key:alice-issuer#key-1",
      "proofPurpose": "assertionMethod",
      "proofValue": "..."
    }
  }],
  "proof": {
    "type": "Ed25519Signature2020", 
    "created": "2025-07-22T10:00:00Z",
    "challenge": "random-challenge-from-bob",
    "verificationMethod": "did:key:alice-node#key-1",
    "proofPurpose": "authentication",
    "proofValue": "..."
  }
}
```

### 3. Mutual Authentication
- Both parties present VCs with challenge-response proofs
- Verify signatures and credential validity
- Establish trust based on credential attributes
- Derive session keys for encrypted communication

### 4. Secure Channel Establishment
```javascript
// Post-VC authentication
const sharedSecret = deriveSharedSecret(aliceKeys, bobKeys);
const sessionKey = hkdf(sharedSecret, "session-key", 32);

// All subsequent messages encrypted
const encryptedMessage = encrypt(sessionKey, message);
```

## Implementation Components

### VC Wallet Integration
```javascript
class VCWallet {
  constructor() {
    this.credentials = new Map();
    this.keys = new KeyManager();
    this.did = this.generateDID();
  }
  
  async presentCredential(challenge, credentialType) {
    const credential = this.credentials.get(credentialType);
    return this.createPresentation(credential, challenge);
  }
  
  async verifyPresentation(presentation, challenge) {
    // Verify signatures and credential validity
    return this.cryptoVerify(presentation, challenge);
  }
}
```

### Trust Framework
```javascript
class TrustFramework {
  constructor() {
    this.trustedIssuers = new Set();
    this.revocationLists = new Map();
    this.trustPolicies = new PolicyEngine();
  }
  
  async evaluateTrust(presentation) {
    // Check issuer trust
    // Verify credential status
    // Apply trust policies
    return this.computeTrustScore(presentation);
  }
}
```

## Key Benefits in Federated Mobile Environment

### Flexible Authorization
- Credentials can encode complex permissions
- Fine-grained access control
- Time-bound and conditional access
- Easy delegation and revocation

### Offline Capabilities

## Security Considerations

### Credential Management
- Secure storage of private keys and credentials
- Key rotation and credential refresh
- Backup and recovery procedures
- Protection against device compromise

### Revocation Strategy
- Distributed revocation lists
- Time-bound credentials with short lifespans
- Cryptographic accumulator schemes
- Gossip-based revocation propagation

### Trust Bootstrapping
- Initial credential issuance process
- Root trust anchor management
- Trust network discovery
- Cold start scenarios

## Migration Path from TLS

### Phase 1: Hybrid Approach
- Use TLS for external connections
- Use VCs for federated party authentication
- Gradual replacement of certificate-based trust

### Phase 2: VC-Native
- Replace TLS certificates with VCs entirely
- Implement VC-based transport security
- Full decentralized trust model

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
- Zero-knowledge credential presentations
- Anonymous credentials for privacy
- Threshold signatures for multi-party trust
- Integration with blockchain/DLT systems

## Conclusion

Replacing TLS with Verifiable Credentials in a federated mobile environment provides:

- **Decentralized Trust**: No single points of failure
- **Rich Identity**: Complex attributes and permissions
- **Mobile-Native**: Built for dynamic, peer-to-peer scenarios
- **Future-Proof**: Standards-based, extensible architecture

This approach aligns perfectly with the CommServer relay architecture, where the transport layer remains simple and unauthenticated, while sophisticated trust and identity management happens at the application layer using cryptographically-verifiable credentials.
