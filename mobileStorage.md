# Mobile Storage Persistence Investigation

## Issue Summary

We're encountering a critical issue with channel persistence in the mobile environment where LLM objects are successfully created and stored in memory but fail to persist properly to storage:

1. LLM objects exist in the in-memory cache but not in persistent storage
2. `postToChannel` operations update the channel head in memory but fail to persist it to storage
3. The channel head pointer shows a mismatch between cache and storage state

From the logs:
```
[CHANNEL_POST] Before posting to channel llm - head: null
[CHANNEL_POST] After posting to channel llm - head: abab85e9e522f70a006afb88d8ffc6c0ecba994e141fee2318c0561577bf446a
[CHANNEL_POST] Stored version after post - head: null
[CHANNEL_POST] Head pointer mismatch detected - cache: abab85e9e522f70a006afb88d8ffc6c0ecba994e141fee2318c0561577bf446a, storage: undefined
```

This leads to LLM objects being temporarily available but lost after application restart.

## Investigation Plan

To understand the root cause, we need to investigate three key areas:

1. **Mobile Storage Layer**: Compare our Expo implementation with the reference implementation
2. **Channel Manager**: Review our channel manager implementation vs reference
3. **Channel Usage Patterns**: Analyze how one.leute uses channels successfully

## 1. Mobile Storage Layer Analysis

### Current Implementation

Our current storage implementation in `one.core/src/system/expo` needs to be examined for deviations from the reference implementation, focusing on:

- Storage operations for versioned objects
- Transaction handling and commit mechanisms
- Error handling and recovery strategies

### Reference Implementation Analysis

We need to examine the reference implementation in the root folder's one.core to identify:

- How storage operations are synchronized
- What guarantees are made for persistence
- If there are platform-specific adaptations

## 2. Channel Manager Implementation Review

### ChannelManager in Current Code

Current implementation in our project:
- Uses the standard `postToChannel` method
- Successfully updates in-memory cache
- Detects but doesn't rectify head pointer mismatches

### Reference ChannelManager

We need to compare with the reference implementation to check if:
- There are additional steps for storage persistence
- There's a mechanism to recover from mismatch situations
- There are mobile-specific adaptations we're missing

## 3. Channel Usage Patterns in one.leute

Analyze how one.leute uses channels successfully:

- How LLM objects are stored and retrieved
- What patterns ensure persistence across sessions
- If there are additional synchronization mechanisms

## Storage Stack Analysis

The storage stack involves multiple layers:

1. **Application Layer**: LLMManager
2. **Model Layer**: ChannelManager
3. **Core Layer**: Storage abstractions (versioned and unversioned)
4. **Platform Layer**: Expo-specific implementations

The issue appears to be occurring between layers 3 and 4, where changes from the storage abstractions aren't being correctly committed to the platform's persistence mechanism.

## Key Questions to Answer

1. Is the issue specific to the mobile/simulator environment?
2. Is there a missing commit or synchronization operation after updating the channel head?
3. Are there differences in transaction handling between reference and our implementation?
4. Are there differences in how one.leute handles channel persistence compared to our implementation?

## Next Steps

After gathering this information, we'll be able to:

1. Identify the exact point of failure in the persistence chain
2. Develop a targeted fix that addresses the root cause
3. Implement proper validation to ensure persistence is working correctly
